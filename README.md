## This is my take on a handmade Linear Regression.

Since Linear Regression is the simplest, yet works as foundation for more complex Machine Learning algorithms, like SVM or Neural Networks. I wanted to tackle this proyect and understand better how they work

I refreshed the mathematics needed for this proyect through the book Mathematics for Machine Learning wrote by Aldo Faisal y Marc Peter Deisenroth.

At the end I imported the same model from scikit-learn to compare the results using the california houses dataset. This results were similar to the point there is almost no difference in the performace, making this a success.
