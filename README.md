# Handmade Linear Regression

This is my take on a handmade Linear Regression model.

Linear Regression is the simplest machine learning algorithm, yet it serves as the foundation for more complex models like Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks. That’s why I wanted to tackle this project — to gain a deeper understanding of how these models work under the hood.

To prepare, I refreshed the necessary mathematical concepts using _Mathematics for Machine Learning_ by Marc Peter Deisenroth and Aldo Faisal.

In the end, I compared my implementation with the `LinearRegression` model from Scikit-learn using the California Housing dataset. The results were nearly identical in performance, which makes this project a success.
